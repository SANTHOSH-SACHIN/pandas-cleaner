## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Choose your preferred installation method:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install git+https://github.com/SANTHOSH-SACHIN/pandas-cleaner.git

# Using uv (recommended)
uv pip install git+https://github.com/SANTHOSH-SACHIN/pandas-cleaner.git

# Development installation
git clone https://github.com/SANTHOSH-SACHIN/pandas-cleaner.git
cd pandas-cleaner
uv pip install -e .
```

## üéØ Usage

### Starting the Application

Launch the application with a single command:

```bash
pandas-cleaner start  # Starts on default port 8501
pandas-cleaner start --port 8000  # Use custom port
```

### Data Cleaning Workflow

1. üì§ **Upload Your Data**
   - Use the sidebar file uploader to select your data file
   - Supported formats: CSV, Excel (.xlsx, .xls), Parquet
   - Preview your data in the interactive table
   - Automatic format detection and optimized loading

2. üßπ **Clean Your Data**
   - **Missing Values**
     ```python
     # Using Polars (faster)
     if use_polars:
         df = df.drop_nulls()  # or
         df = df.fill_null(df.mean())
     # Using Pandas (compatible)
     else:
         df = df.dropna()  # or
         df = df.fillna(df.mean())
     ```
   - **Filtering**
     ```python
     # Using Polars (faster)
     if use_polars:
         df = df.filter(pl.col("age") > 25 & pl.col("category") == "A")
     # Using Pandas (compatible)
     else:
         df = df.query("age > 25 and category == 'A'")
     ```
   - **Aggregation**
     ```python
     # Using Polars (faster)
     if use_polars:
         df = (df.group_by("category")
               .agg([pl.col("value").mean()])
               .collect())
     # Using Pandas (compatible)
     else:
         df = df.groupby(['category']).agg('mean').reset_index()
     ```

3. üíª **Export Your Work**
   - Click "Generate Python Code" to get production-ready code
   - Copy-paste into your data pipeline
   - All operations are automatically logged

4. ‚è± **Session Management**
   - Work is automatically saved
   - Resume from where you left off
   - Switch between multiple sessions

### Advanced Features

- **Custom Value Imputation**: Fill missing values with domain-specific defaults
- **Complex Queries**: Use the full power of Pandas query syntax
- **Aggregation Functions**: Support for sum, mean, count, min, max, and more
- **State Management**: Improved persistence between operations
